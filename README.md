<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹ we are Track2</h1>
<h3 align="center">A group of software-engineers-in-training. This is our first BackEnd project!</h3>




### ðŸš€ Project Outline

---

<p> In this project we have built an API for a concert booking system. It implements Java, SpringBoot and a Postgres SQL Database. 

The two classes of `Concert` and `Attendee` will have a many-to-many relationship.

</p>


###  ðŸŒ± MVP

---

<p>
For started our project by defining our MVP. We decided the most integral logic of the application would be:

- creating, removing and updating concert details
- creating, removing and updating attendee details
- ability to add and remove attendees from concerts
- the ability to display all concerts and all attendees

### ðŸŽ¸ Concert

---
Within the Concert Model we have defined the following properties: a `concert id`, `ticket price`, `capacity`, `date`, `time`, `artist` and a `list of attendees`.

Our `Concert` and `Attendee` classes have a many-to-many relationship and as such `attendees` can be removed or added to a `concert`.

In accordance with the principles of a many-to-many relationships it is possible for a `concert` to have many `attendees` and for an `attendee` to be going to many `concerts`.

### ðŸŽ¹ Attendee

---
Each Attendee object has an attendee id, name, email address, phone number and a list of concerts they will be attending.

Attendees can be created or removed from the Repository as well as added or removed from individual concerts.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack :

---
- Intellij, JDK 17
- Spring Boot
- PostgresSQL
- Postman
- Postico

### Extensions

---
We were able to implement several of our ideas for extending our projects' functionality. They are as follows:
- We added a **Data Transfer Object** class to handle bookings
- We developed some **error handling** by adding response messages.
These related to letting the user know a concert/attendee has been successfully removed.
As well as writing an if/else statement to make sure only attendees and concerts with id's in existence could be updated/removed/added.
Similarly, if an id that doesn't exist is inputted in this way, an error message will be returned 
- We added some **derived queries** (see below, section Filter and Sort)


## ðŸ’¬ How to use the API

---
### RESTful roots:
**Concert**
- GET http://localhost:8080/concerts ---â–º
gets all concerts
- GET http://localhost:8080/concerts/1 ---â–º
  gets a concert by id
- GET http://localhost:8080/concerts/ticketPrices/over150 ---â–º
Find concerts where the ticket price is greater than 150
- GET http://localhost:8080/concerts/capacities ---â–º
Sort concerts by capacity (Lowest to Highest)
- GET http://localhost:8080/concerts/ticketPrices ---â–º
Sort concerts by ticket price (Highest to Lowest)
- POST http://localhost:8080/concerts ---â–º
creating a new concert
- PUT http://localhost:8080/concerts/2 ---â–º
updating a concert
- PATCH http://localhost:8080/concerts/1 ---â–º
adding an attendee to a concert
- DELETE http://localhost:8080/concerts/1/attendees/3 ---â–º
removing an attendee from a concert
- DELETE http://localhost:8080/concerts/6 ---â–º
deleting a concert
---
**Attendee**
- GET http://localhost:8080/attendees ---â–º
gets all attendees
- GET http://localhost:8080/attendees/3 ---â–º
gets an attendee by id
- GET http://localhost:8080/attendees/names ---â–º
Getting a list of attendees name
- GET http://localhost:8080/attendees/numberOfAttendees ---â–º
Get number of attendees
- POST http://localhost:8080/attendees ---â–º
creating a new attendee
- PUT http://localhost:8080/attendees/5 ---â–º
updating an attendee
- DELETE http://localhost:8080/attendees/4 ---â–º
deleting an attendee



## ðŸ“« How to install and run the project

---
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/caitlinmillar/Backend_Concert
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Backend_Concert
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
## Roadmap

---
The features we would like to implement in the future are as follows:
- Separate the property Artist *into its own class*
- Replace the strings of 'date' and 'time' with *LocalDate and LocalTime*
- Add parameter of age linked to Attendee
- Logic to define the age restrictions on a concert. Then add a Boolean which takes in an Attendee's age to confirm whether they are permitted to attend the concert or not.
